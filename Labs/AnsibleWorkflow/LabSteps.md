# Lab Exercise 

>**Please note that the images used in the lab guide are representative and NOT based on any specific pod. Please use the information in the lab guide instead.**

## Getting started ##

Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) technology provides the capability to insert Layer 4 through Layer 7 (L4-L7) functions using an approach called a service graph. The servive graph controls network connectivity consisting of VLANs.

Lab will be used to demonstrate L4-L7 service insertion in unmanaged mode to simulate an enterprise network and/or cloud providerâ€™s application delivery offering while allowing the application owner to manage the L4-L7 device using Ansible. 

The topology used for this Lab is as follows:

![](images/Ansible-topology.png)

The goal is to provide a central point of control to configure both the Cisco APIC as well as the F5 BIG-IP. Network stitching is achieved by automating the deployment of a service graph on APIC and L4-L7 configuration is automated directly on the BIG-IP

![](images/Ansible-logicaldiagram.png)

**For this lab**
* We will use the F5 BIG-IP VE Virtual ADC to demonstrate this functionality
* The service graph will be deployed in One-ARM mode which implies **one** interface will be consumed on the BIG-IP which handles the client as well as server traffic
* A default route will be configured on the BIG-IP
* SNAT = 'Automap' will be configured on the BIG-IP (return traffic from backend servers are forced to pass back through the BIG-IP)
* The EPG's used are **web-epg**(provider) and **l3out-epg** (consumer). Bridge domain **vip-bd**

**Let's begin the lab**

## Automate configuration on APIC and BIG-IP using Ansible

We will provision the APIC and BIG-IP using Ansible for a couple of reasons. Ansible is an open source automation platform that can help with configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It can also do IT orchestration, where you have to run tasks in sequence and create a chain of events which must happen on several different servers or devices.

Red Hat Ansible Tower provides a single point of control your IT infrastructure with a visual dashboard, role-based access control, job scheduling, integrated notifications and graphical inventory management. 

Connect to the Ansible tower using the following information:

* **Ansible Tower Address**: 172.21.208.250
* **username**: {TSTUDENT}
* **password**: cisco123

Once you are logged in click on **Projects** located in the top level menu
Click on **Lab-Git-Project**. This is a view only permission.

Go back to Ansible Tower. A workflow has been created in Ansible Tower to chain the execution of the above two playbooks

Scroll down -> Click on the template **Configure-Workflow**. 
This is a workflow template consisting of two playbooks we viewed earlier
1) Configure-ACI
2) Configure-BIG-IP

![](images/Tower-Workflow.png)

Click on the 'Workflow Editor' button to view the workflow configured

![](images/Tower-Workflow1.png)

After viewing 'close' the workflow editor

![](images/Tower-Workflow2.png)

Now we will view the parameters that we are going to pass to the playbook for execution. There are two methods through which we are passing variables to the playbook. One is through the **Extra Variables** text box and the other is through the **Survey**

![](images/Tower-variables.png)

View the paramters in the **Extra Variables** text box. Values that you provide here will be provided as input to the playbooks in the workflow

![](images/Tower-Workflow3.png)


Scroll through and make sure the following paramters are specified:

```
#################
#APIC information

   - http
```

Scroll to the bottom and click on the 'Rocket' icon next to the template.

![](images/Tower-LaunchWorkflow.png)

This will launch the playbook. A survey will pop up when the rocket button is clicked.
The survey is an Ansible Tower feature to allow users to provide input to the playbook while executing the playbook. These are variables passed to the playbook along with the input provided in the 'Extra Variables' text box earlier.

```
In the Survey enter the following:
BIG-IP - device type = 'virtual'
BIG-IP - High Availability or Stand Alone = "SA"
BIG-IP - Do you want to on-board? = 'yes'
BIG-IP - Deploy L7 configuration? = 'yes'
BIG-IP IPAddress = '172.21.208.109'
BIG-IP username = 'admin'
BIG-IP password = 'cisco123'
APIC IPAddress = '172.21.208.173'
APIC username = 'studentxx'	#Replace xx to your student ID
APIC password = 'ciscolive.2018'
APIC Tenant Name = 'studentxx'	#Replace xx to your student ID
```
Click Launch once the Survey is filled according to the parameters above

![](images/Tower-LaunchSurvey.png)

At this point the playbook is executing. It will first configure the APIC and then the BIG-IP

You will see the status of the playbook is in mode **Running**. The workflow will first execute Configure-ACI playbook. Click on details

![](images/Tower-RunWorflow1.png)

The new window will indicate the progress of running playbook **Configure-ACI**

![](images/Tower-RunWorflow2.png)

After the playbook has executed sucessfully click on **Jobs** on the top left hand corner

![](images/Tower-RunWorflow3.png)

You will see the Configure-Workflow job being executed (blinking green icon next to it), click it. It will take you back to the workflow execution, at this point the **Configure-ACI** playbook would have executed sucessfully and the playbook **Configure-BIG-IP** will be getting executed. Click on details

![](images/Tower-RunWorflow4.png)

![](images/Tower-RunWorflow5.png)

Once the playbook has executed sucessfully again click on **Jobs**. You will see five jobs got executed as part of the workflow. From the bottom

* Git project SCM update (before a playbook is run the GIT repo is updated to make sure the latest code is available)
* Configure-ACI
* Git project SCM update
* Configure-BIG-IP
* Workflow execution

The JOB ID in the screen shot does not need to match what you see

On the APIC GUI click on **Tenants**. In the Tenant Search text box enter your student ID. Example: student01. This will open up your tenant on the left hand side of the APIC GUI pane

![](images/APIC-Tenant.png)

In the left hand pane under your tenant to view the logical device cluster deployed click on **Services->L4-L7->Devices->bigip**

![](images/APIC-LDC.png)

In the logical device cluster the following has been configured
* Name: **bigip**  
* Service Type: **ADC**  
* Device Type: **Virtual**  
* VMM Domain: **VMware/CLBerlin2016** 
* View: **Single Node**
* Context Aware: **Single**  
* Function Type: **GoTo**  
* Device 1
	* VM Nme: **{TBIGIPVM}** #Name of the BIG-IP Virtual Edition
	* vCenter name: **DMZ_VC**
	* Interface: 1_1 (One arm mode so only one interface on BIG-IP specified for client and server traffic)
* Logical interface
	* Consumer is mapped to Device1 interface 1_1
	* Provider is mapped to Device1 interface 1_1

In the left hand pane under your tenant to view the service graph template click on **Services->L4-L7->Service Graph Template->sgt**

![](images/APIC-SGT.png)

The service graph template has been configured
* One-Arm mode
* Associated to logical device cluster **bigip** 

To deploy the service graph a few steps are needed 1) Assign service graph template to contract 2)Create device selection policy 3) Attach contracts to the correct EPG's

In the left hand pane under your tenant to view the contract click on **Contracts->Standard->cntr**

![](images/APIC-Contract.png)

The service graph template **sgt** has been assigned to the contract

In the left hand pane under your tenant to view the device selection policy click on **Services->L4-L7->Device Selection Policy->cntr-sgt-ADC**

![](images/APIC-SGT.png)

The logical device context instructs Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) about which load balancer device to use to render a graph. The device **bigip** is assigned for rendering the graph

In the left hand pane under your tenant to view the provided contract assigned to the EPG's click on **Application Profiles->app->Application EPGs->web-epg->Contracts**

![](images/APIC-Prov-Contract.png)

Contract **cntr** is assigned as a Provided contract to EPG **web-epg**

In the left hand pane under your tenant to view the consumer contract assigned to the EPG's click on **Networking->External Routed Networks->studentxx-l3out->Networks->epg-l3out** (where studentxx represents your student ID)

![](images/APIC-Cons-Contract.png)

Contract **cntr** is assigned as a Consumer contract to EPG **epg-l3out**

In the left hand pane under your tenant to view the deployed graph click on **Services->L4-L7-Deployed Graph Instances**

![](images/APIC-Deployed-Graph.png)

The graph is in state **applied** which indicates it was deployed correctly

### Verify BIG-IP configuration

Letâ€™s log into the F5 BIG-IP **{TBIGIPIP}** with the following username and password from the web browser 

* BIG-IP: **[https://{TBIGIPIP}](https://{TBIGIPIP})**  
* Username: **admin**  
* Password: **cisco123**  

On the left Navigation menu, click the **Network -> VLAN** and you should be able to see the vlan assigned to the interface 1_1

![](images/BIGIP-vlan.png)

On the left Navigation menu, click the **Network -> Self IPs** and you should be able to see the Self-IP added and assigend to VLAN above

![](images/BIGIP-Selfip.png)

On the left Navigation menu, Click **Local Traffic -> Nodes** and you should see the brief information of the real server pool information

![](images/BIGIP-nodes.png)

Click **Local Traffic -> Pools** , click on the Pool

![](images/BIGIP-pool.png)

Click the hyperlink under **Name** and you should be directed to the Pool **Properties** page. Now click the **Members** tab and you should see the real servers (pool members) we configured when we were deploying the service graph.

![](images/BIGIP-poolmembers.png)

Click the **Local Traffic -> Virtual Servers** and you should be able to see the brief Virtual IP information. You can see that the VIP is currently listening on HTTP port 80.

![](images/BIGIP-vs.png)

In the **Virtual Server List**, click the **Name** in the hyperlink and you will see the **Property** of the Virtual Server with more detailed information. The configured the parameters will appear here. 

Click the **Resources** tab and you should see the both **Default** and **Fallback** persistence profiles are set to **None**. Also the **Default Pool** has been set.

![](images/BIGIP-vs1.png)

You can now verify the Virtual Server (or VIP) by using your browser and entering the VIP into the address window:  

URL: **[http://{TL2F5VIP}](http://{TL2F5VIP})**  

You should see the page with the hostname of your VMs similar to the following:   

Press the enter button (do not use the refresh button of your browser) at the IP address **{TL2F5VIP}** at the web browser, you should see a different page and the VIP is load balanced by the ADC.

We have verified connectivity to the web server via the ADC VIP.
